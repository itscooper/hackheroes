Agent, weâ€™ve found the personal webpage of SneakySteve, the leader of the Chaos Crew! This page includes his vault, which is where they keep all their prank materials. The vault is locked with a password, but SneakySteve has left some clues about himself that might help you crack it.

Your mission is to use the clues on the webpage to figure out the vault password.

Good luck, agent!
