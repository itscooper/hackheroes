Agent, the Chaos Crew is planning a banana-themed prank at the city zoo, but they’ve scrambled the name of their first target to keep it secret from outsiders. We’ve intercepted their chat, and now it’s up to you to unscramble the hidden location.

Your mission is to decode the scrambled message and type the correct location into the box. If you can figure it out, you’ll be one step ahead of their prank!

Stay sharp, agent! You’ve got this!
