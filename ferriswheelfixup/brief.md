Agent, fantastic work stopping the Chaos Crew at the zoo! Your quick actions kept everyone safe. But it seems the Chaos Crew isn't finished yet â€” they've taken their tricks to a new location! FunLand is the city's biggest and most beloved amusement park filled with families and laughter. But not for long... the Chaos Crew are up to no good again!

Their latest mischief? They've hacked into FunLand's Ferris Wheel control system, bringing it to a sudden stop. Visitors are stranded at the very top, and they're starting to worry.

We need you to access the Ferris Wheel's control panel and figure out how to restart it. We've discovered there's a special command hidden within the system that can get the Ferris Wheel moving again. Use your tech skills to find and run this command.

Time is ticking, Agent. Good luck!
